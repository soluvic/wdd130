        <p>Hello, everyone! My name is Victor Solomon, and I am from Lagos, Nigeria. I'm excited to be part of this
            class and learn with all of you.</p>
        <p>I’ve been working in the cryptocurrency industry for the past 7 years as a crypto analyst at Crypto Asset
            Buyer. I also founded a crypto learning community called Soluvic Crypto Hub, where I help beginners
            understand blockchain technology and navigate the crypto space safely.</p>
        <p>Right now, I'm studying Software Development at BYU-Idaho to expand my skills and explore new opportunities
            in tech. I'm passionate about technology, learning, and helping others succeed. Looking forward to
            connecting and collaborating with you all this semester.</p>
